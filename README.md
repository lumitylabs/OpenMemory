## 🔎 Why? 
In our daily lives, both at work and personally, we face an increasing volume of information that exceeds the natural capacities of the human brain. OpenMemory was developed to meet this challenge by enhancing our ability to process, memorize, and manage data and information. This not only reduces cognitive overload but also improves decision-making and knowledge management.

## 💡 How does it Work?  
OpenMemory uses sensors and computing resources to collect data from our activities, organizing it efficiently into a memory system. With the support of artificial intelligence and an intuitive interface, Open Memory enables quick consultation and the generation of new insights from the stored information.

## 💻 Minimum Requeriments
- Windows 10+ Operating System
- Nvidia GPU 8GB VRAM
- Pre-installed CUDA 11.8 or 12.1
###### **For using OpenMemory, it is highly recommended to use version 11.8 for optimal performance**

## 💿 Installation
### **Step 1 - Installing CUDA 11.8**  
- Check if you have _CUDA 11.8_ installed.  
- If you do not have it yet, **[click here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive?target_os=Windows)** to download and install it.

### **Step 2 - Installing OpenMemory**  
- Download the _"release-v1"_ file **[click here](https://github.com/lumitylabs/OpenMemory/releases/download/v1.0.0/release-v1.zip)**  
- Extract the file into a folder  
- Run _"setup_CUDA_118.bat"_ if you have installed CUDA version 11.8    
###### The installation may take a few minutes, depending on your internet connection
