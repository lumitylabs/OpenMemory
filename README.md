## 🔎 Why? 
In our daily lives, both at work and personally, we face an increasing volume of information that exceeds the natural capacities of the human brain. OpenMemory was developed to meet this challenge by enhancing our ability to process, memorize, and manage data and information. This not only reduces cognitive overload but also improves decision-making and knowledge management.

## 💡 How does it Work?  
OpenMemory uses sensors and computing resources to collect data from our activities, organizing it efficiently into a memory system. With the support of artificial intelligence and an intuitive interface, Open Memory enables quick consultation and the generation of new insights from the stored information.
